      <p>I was 17 years old when I read Stephen Hawkings book "A Brief History of Time". His book ignighted a drive in me to learn more about our universe. That drive is still alive in me to this day. I have selected several key points in his life for this tribute page. If you would like to learn more you can click on the link located at the bottom of this page.</p>
